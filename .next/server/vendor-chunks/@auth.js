It is likely that your application would benefit from leveraging these battle-tested solutions rather than try to rebuild them from scratch.\n *\n * If you'd still like to build password-based authentication for your application despite these risks, Auth.js gives you full control to do so.\n *\n * :::\n *\n * See the [callbacks documentation](/reference/core#authconfig#callbacks) for more information on how to interact with the token. For example, you can add additional information to the token by returning an object from the `jwt()` callback:\n *\n * ```js\n * callbacks: {\n *   async jwt({ token, user, account, profile, isNewUser }) {\n *     if (user) {\n *       token.id = user.id\n *     }\n *     return token\n *   }\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * @example\n * ```js\n * import Auth from \"@auth/core\"\n * import Credentials from

You can open an issue, but if the problem is non-compliance with the spec,\n * we might not pursue a resolution.
